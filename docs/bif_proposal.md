## Project Information

- Project Name: International Elections API
- Project Analogy: It's like a Wiki API but for elections data
- Project Haiku: Ballots like leaves fall / Rivers carry them downstream / Time hears nations' call.

### Project Description

Envision a platform aggregating election results from around the world, making them accessible and analyzable. This project aims to democratize access to election data, empowering researchers and journalists while fueling anyone's bad ideas.

## Bylaw Questions

### How is this project a bad idea?

The project is overwhelming and challenging to maintain up-to-date and accurate data from so many global sources.

### If this project were a D&D Character, what alignment would it be and why?

- [Chaotic Good](http://easydamus.com/chaoticgood.html): Aims to free information, challenging structures that hoard knowledge

### Where are the lulz?

Celebrating the weirdest election laws and data worldwide.

### How does this project make people thinking face emoji?

Confronts people with the complexities and variances of democracies globally. Humans are messy, and organizing them into any functioning group is a loveably flawed process no matter how much authority any governing body claims.
